I've decided to start over on this blog. All the old, irrelevant posts have been archived and removed for the sake of being able to take this website in a new direction. 

I'm hoping to post a little bit more about my programming work, whether it be any discoveries that I make, demonstrations or showcases. Hopefully this will help my site fit better into the purpose I initially intended for it to fulfill.

Ciao for now,
